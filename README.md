<sup>**_One script, all tools, add User, update ALL and more._**</sup>
<sup>**_Upgrades / Updates your new install of [Kali](https://www.kali.org/) Linux._**</sup>


This basic script will update your _[Kali](https://www.kali.org/)_ Linux install to the latest version of _[Kali](https://www.kali.org/)_. 

It will also do the following:

- **Install** *_[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)._

- **Add** 2 Aliases :
  - **_ls_**           -  More info when 'ls' command is given.
   - **_apt-updater_** - update tools, upgrade Distro, clean useless files, etc... and reboot.

- **Create** a new _Low Privilege_ user and add this user to the **_Sudo_ Group.** (Not a good idea to **always** be **Root**)   

- **Install** _*[Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/). *[Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/)_ is a tiling terminal emulator. This is a personal preference. You can replace _*[Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/)_ in the code to whatever you want.
  _*[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)_ and _*[Screen](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/screen.html)_ are a couple of other good options.

- **Install** the 'Everything' _[Kali](https://www.kali.org/)_ [Meta Package](https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-metapackages/). This includes ALL the tools _[Kali](https://www.kali.org/)_ has to offer. (This may take a while)

- **Install** _*[Gedit](https://gedit.en.softonic.com/)_. _*[Gedit](https://gedit.en.softonic.com/)_ is a useful text editor. Again, this is personal Preference and can be changed to whatever you want.

- **Install** _*[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)._ 

** You will have to agree to some of these downloads and / or installs as it runs through the script. ( Entering 'y')

** It is also necessary to change a couple lines in the script. The lines that need changed are:

^^ **_Replace_** <username> on **_both_** lines to whatever you want your new username to be.^^

--Simply run this script in the _[Kali](https://www.kali.org/)_ Terminal--         

That's it! This is a very basic script I have made just to learn Linux and _[Kali](https://www.kali.org/)_. I am just getting starting learning Linux and thought it maybe useful to someone else. Feel Free to Correct or Critique me on anything you see that I could have done better. Happy Hacking!
